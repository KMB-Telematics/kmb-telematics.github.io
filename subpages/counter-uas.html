							<!-- The integration of a counter-drone / counter-UAS (cUAS) system is incomplete without incorporating radar, as it plays a crucial role in the system. Unlike other sensors, radar is capable of detecting autonomous GPS-guided / non-RF emitting drones regardless of weather conditions and lighting. KMB's imaging radar approach is exceptional, as it enables the detection and classification of targets that are otherwise undetectable by other radars. Moreover, the KMB radar provides high-quality radar imagery that can be further processed through machine learning (ML) / AI to classify targets, eliminate false positives, or amalgamate with other sensors such as cameras / EO/IR. -->
							Radar is a vital part of an integrated counter-drone / counter-UAS (cUAS) system. Radar is the only sensor that can see autonomous GPS-guided / non-RF emitting drones in all weather, day or night. KMB's unique imaging radar approach can detect and classify targets that other radars cannot. KMB radar provides rich radar imagery that can be processed with machine learning (ML) / AI to classify targets, reject false positives, or to fuse with other sensors such as cameras / EO/IR.

							<!-- KMB's software-defined imaging radar surpasses the outdated legacy radars that are presently employed for drone detection. KMB radar has achieved a significant milestone by being the first radar that can detect drones that are stationary and hovering. Most of the existing radars eliminate slow-moving objects to declutter the radar's output and adjust for the low resolution of the radar. In contrast, KMB's radar delivers high resolution and full-scene imaging, enabling it to identify an endless number of targets, whether they are stationary or in motion. -->
							KMB software-defined imaging radar is a generation ahead of legacy radars currently used for drone detection. KMB radar is the first that can see stationary, hovering drones. Current radars filter out slow-moving objects to reduce clutter and compensate for the radar's low resolution. KMB radar has high resolution and performs full-scene imaging. This allows KMB radar to see an unlimited number of targets, whether they are moving or stationary.
						</p>
						<p>
							<!-- In addition, KMB's patented technology generates radar images with an extremely high dynamic range, enabling the radar to identify faint objects in close proximity to bright ones. Consequently, the radar becomes capable of detecting targets in complex situations that were previously considered unattainable. For instance, it can detect drones amidst clutter, such as trees or low-lying obstacles, and in urban settings where bright radar reflectors, like buildings, may pose a challenge. -->
							In addition, KMB's patented technology forms radar images with very high dynamic range. This allows the radar to see very faint objects next to very bright objects. This allows radar to be used to detect targets in challenging scenarios that were previously impossible, such as seeing drones near clutter—for example near trees or low to the ground, or seeing drones in urban environments, near very bright radar reflectors like buildings.
